# Cooking The India's Best Rice

# Take a bowl of rice how much you require 

# Take some water in the bowl for washing your rice 

# Complete washing the rice throughly and the dirt should git removed out 

# After washing the rice take some water again in the bowl for the rice to cook 

# On the other hand take a cooker and pour some water inside the cooker and the water should not br more than the bowl of the rice means it shoul not come up.

# Gas on and let the rice steam until there are three whistles from the cooker.

# Let the steam of the cooker go and then open the cooker 

# Here is you rice ready 

# * Tip : Do not take a big bowl which cant fit inside the cooker take a small one and as per you r taste you can add salt in the  rice after washing the rice while pouring some water or after cooking the rice while you make the biryani or any other thing add the salt that time
